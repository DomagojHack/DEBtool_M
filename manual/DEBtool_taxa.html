<H3>Toolbox: taxa</H3>

Selection and presentation of taxa in the add_my_pet collection. 
The taxa are specified by lists-of-lists, where each entry in any list is a name of a new list. 
Together these lists specify a tree, were the leaves are the entries in the add_my_pet collection.
The total number of leaves exactly matches to total number of entries in the collection.
A leave can be recognized by having character `_'.

The function <a href="../taxa/html/select.html"><code>select</code></a> selects all entries in the add_my_pet collection that belong to a specified taxon (of any rank). 
The function <a href="../taxa/html/lineage.html"><code>lineage</code></a> outputs a cell-string that starts with taxon `Animalia' and ends with the specified taxon, with all the steps in between in its phylogeny. 
The function <a href="../taxa/html/clade.html"><code>clade</code></a> combines these two functions in the sense that it returns a cell string of all entries that belong to the taxon to which specified taxa belong. 
Function <a href="../taxa/html/list_taxa.html"><code>list_taxa</code></a> returns a cell string of all taxa of all ranks in alphabetic order. 
It finds application, for instance, in <a href="../lib/misc/html/select_legend.html"><code>select_legend</code></a> 

<p>
The function <a href="../taxa/html/select_taxon.html"><code>select_taxon</code></a> selects one taxon from an alphabetic list of all possible taxa (of any rank); it finds application in <a href="../lib/misc/html/select_legend.html"><code>select_legend</code></a>. Function <a href="../taxa/html/select_legend.html"><code>select_legend</code></a> modifies or sets a legend, defined as (marker, taxon)-pairs.


<HR>
<H4><A NAME="treeview">treeview</A></H4>

The function <a href="../taxa/html/treeview_taxa.html"><code>treeview_taxa</code></a> produces a treeview of a pedigree of a specified taxon in file <a href="../taxa/treeview_taxa.html"><code>treeview_taxa.html</code></a>. 
You have to open this file with a brouwser to see the tree and walk through it.
A pedigree is a character string produced by function  <a href="../taxa/html/pedigree.html"><code>pedigree</code></a> that presents the phylogeny of a specified taxon. For taxa of higher rank, the result of pedigree is hard to read. The leaves in treeview_taxa link to entry pages, the other nodes to pictures.

<p>
Function <a href="../taxa/html/pie_Animalia.html"><code>pie_Animalia</code></a> presens a pie of 2 till 8 segments of the relative frequencies of animal taxa in the add_my_pet collection.
